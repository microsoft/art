## For Evaluation
Evaluation notebook on databricks - input 2 pickle files:

**metadata.pkl**: list of (content, style) tuples

**features-{model}.pkl**: 2D numpy array (data points x length of feature vector) of feature vectors

features.py writes out the 2 pkl files for resnets currently.

Work done on day one of the hackathon, deploys model onto AzureML to be run from a webservice

## Prerequisites

Visual Studio/Visual Studio Code (if you use Visual Studio Code to set up your python environment use ctrl+shift+p, "Python: Select Interpreter") \
Anaconda 3.7 \
Azure Machine Learning workspace \
Azure Machine Learning SDK (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py) \
Docker \
Tensorflow \
Keras

## Setup

One time run of either deploy.py or deploy2.py depending on which model is being used to deploy the model to the target

## Running the sample

Run call.py or call2.py depending on which model is being used to simulate a call to the AzureML model

## Key concepts

The general idea is that we are deploying a machine learning model to the cloud as a webservice. The regression model was mostly proof of concept and the Resnet50 model is going to be closer to what we will end up using since we will be handling images.
